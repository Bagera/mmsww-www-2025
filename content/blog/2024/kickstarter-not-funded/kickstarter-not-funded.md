_We lost the battle, but not the war. As always when you try to stand up to The Man and DarkCorp you have to be prepared for them striking back. This time they buried our campaign and scared away all but the most brave backers but it's not like we rolled 13+ on the injury table (death). We will rise again!_

Thank you to all who backed us! We will still get this game to you if you are still interested.

Writing and testing of XDB and it's nearing completion. The digital edition will be released before summer on itch.io and maybe on some more platforms.

The physical version will take some more time but we are planning on starting selling those in the fall. We will try to keep the price the same.
