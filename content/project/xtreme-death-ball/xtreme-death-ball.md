In the year 2X42, desperate people at distant asteroid mining stations, are playing a dangerous sport called Xtreme Death Ball in order to earn their living and uphold their dweller permit at the station.

Xtreme Death Ball is an original TTRPG system where your characters are trying to survive in the harsh environment that is a DarkCorp mining station. The game takes place during the Corpse Grinder Cup of 2X42, where the players have to not only survive the deadly matches, but also the grueling everyday life on the bottom of society.

## The Star Player {.visually-hidden}

Your characters are Star Players, the hardest ballers on your team. Every Star Player has three stats: PWR, SPD, CTL. You stand out in your team and have your special moves that you can perform during a game.

Perhaps you didn't really choose to become a player, you had too. Maybe you are deep in debt and this tournament is your last chance to break free from the clutches of DarkCorp, but The Man won't let you go that easily.

## The Grind {.visually-hidden}

Every week starts with five days of preparing for the next game by training and getting gear. At the same time you have to earn your living by taking gigs in the mine or recuperate from the last game.

It all comes down to being able to pay rent and tax on Pain Day, the day after the game.

## The Game {.visually-hidden}

When you get to the weekend itâ€™s game day, you are pitted against one of the other teams in the Corpse Grinder Cup. You don't simulate the full game, but only the interesting highlights where a team scores or someone is injured. Here Star Players use their moves to build momentum and score.

## The System {.visually-hidden}

Everything you do, from scoring gear to making that special block, is a move. To perform a move you roll 2d12 and add the corresponding stat. If both dice are over 8, you succeed, if only one is over 8, you get a weak success and if neither are, you fail.
