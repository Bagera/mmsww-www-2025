## Chaos is corrupting your city

Something Twisted has infiltrated the guard force of Merchant Lord Mügel. A force has awoken and is reshaping the city, deep underground it is gathering strength and biding its time.

Merchant Lord Mügle needs the help of a party of brave adventurers that can help him claw back his power. A prime opportunity for treasure-hungry pc’s, or, for those goody-two-shoes pc’s, a chance to snuff out a budding cult.

The Maelstrom Prophet is a short system agnostic adventure module to be used with any OSR or NSR game system.

## The dice decide

The module is a highly randomly generated dungeon crawl set in a medieval or renaissance fantasy city.

## Designed with constraints

For our first collaboration we wanted to make something small and fast. We gave ourselves some constraints to make the process faster and more interesting.

## Print your own

First we wanted to make something that anymore could print at home on a black and white printer where you can't print to the edge or cut the bleed away.

## A real book(let)

We didn't want to just make a one page dungeon, but a small booklet and that's how we came up with this fold-out booklet. The folding lets us design a reading experience they gets more chaotic as you delve deeper into the book.

## No straight lines

The art style is an attempt to get away from our normal controlled and square art style, trying to break free and just do whatever comes to mind.

## Where to get it?

Right now you can get it as pwyw on [itch.io](https://mmsww.itch.io/the-maelstrom-prophet)
