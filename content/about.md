# About MMSWW

MMSWW is a small collective based in Malm√∂, Sweden. We make games and such, together.

## David Dormvik

David is our wargame expert. He paints miniatures of all genres and plays with them too.

He is also the one that writes the most for our projects and navigates the endless sea of feature creep.

## Victor Baquero Wihlborg

Victor draws and makes web stuff. He is mostly into RPGs and likes the weird.

He loves the idea phase of the projects and the world building and likes the collaborative creation of stuff.
